diversity
=========

A nifty UI to help anyone make diversity graphs for any organization.

Currently, the UI provides the option to collect metrics about the following diversity points across teams (gender) and across entire organizations:
- gender (male, female, other)
- ethnicity (white, black, asian, hispanic, other)
- sexual orientation (homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, other)
- education level (no degree, high school, undergraduate, master's, doctorate)
- age

Coming soon!
- disability (help!)

Pull requests encouraged if you would like to see another point included in the options!
